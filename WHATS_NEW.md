This approach:

## üîÑ Ready for Blockchain/API

### Current State: Mock Data

All data is currently mocked but structured to match API responses exactly.

### To Connect Real Data:

**Option A: Gradual**

1. Connect wallet (RainbowKit)
2. Replace My Account with real data
3. Replace Round Archive with API
4. Add transaction handling

**Option B: Hybrid**

1. Deploy this as main site
2. Link to existing dashboard for advanced features
3. Gradually migrate features

### Integration Points:

Every page is designed with clear data dependencies documented. Simply swap:

```typescript
// Before (Mock)
import { MOCK_CURRENT_USER } from '@/lib/mockData/users';
const user = MOCK_CURRENT_USER;

// After (API)
import { useUserInfo } from '@/lib/hooks/useUserInfo';
const { data: user } = useUserInfo(address);
```

Components remain unchanged!

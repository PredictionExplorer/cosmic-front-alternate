# Wallet Dropdown - My Account Integration

## Overview
Successfully moved the "My Account" menu items from the main navigation into the wallet dropdown. This provides a cleaner navigation and makes account-related features only accessible when a wallet is connected.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated ConnectWalletButton Component
**File:** `src/components/web3/ConnectWalletButton.tsx`

**New Features:**
- Added "My Account" section in the wallet dropdown
- Includes 4 menu items:
  - **Dashboard** - Main account overview
  - **My NFTs** - User's NFT collection
  - **My Winnings** - Prize history
  - **Activity** - Transaction history
- Each item has an icon for better visual identification
- Active route highlighting (current page shows in primary color)
- Items close the dropdown when clicked

**New Imports:**
```tsx
import { LayoutDashboard, Image, Trophy, Activity } from "lucide-react";
import Link from "next/link";
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
```

**Dropdown Structure (when wallet connected):**
1. **Balances Section**
   - ETH balance
   - CST token balance

2. **My Account Section** (NEW)
   - Dashboard
   - My NFTs
   - My Winnings
   - Activity

3. **Actions Section**
   - Copy Address
   - View Account

4. **Disconnect Section**
   - Disconnect button

### 2. Updated Navigation Constants
**File:** `src/lib/constants.ts`

**Removed:**
- "My Account" submenu from NAV_LINKS
- The entire submenu with Dashboard, My NFTs, My Winnings, and Activity items

**New Navigation Structure:**
```
- Home
- Gallery
- Game
  └─ Play Now
  └─ How It Works
  └─ Prize Structure
  └─ Leaderboard
  └─ Statistics
  └─ Round History
- Stake
- Contracts
- About
```

## User Experience Improvements

### Before:
- "My Account" visible in main navigation even when wallet not connected
- Account pages accessible without wallet (showing empty state)
- Cluttered navigation bar

### After:
- Cleaner main navigation
- Account menu only visible when wallet is connected
- Logical grouping - all wallet-related features in one place
- Better UX - users must connect wallet to access account features
- Active page highlighting in dropdown

## Technical Details

### Active Route Detection
```tsx
const pathname = usePathname();
const isActive = pathname === item.href;
```

### Menu Item Structure
```tsx
const accountMenuItems = [
  { href: "/account", label: "Dashboard", icon: LayoutDashboard },
  { href: "/account/nfts", label: "My NFTs", icon: Image },
  { href: "/account/winnings", label: "My Winnings", icon: Trophy },
  { href: "/account/activity", label: "Activity", icon: Activity },
];
```

### Styling
- **Active state:** `text-primary bg-primary/10`
- **Hover state:** `hover:text-primary hover:bg-background-elevated`
- **Icons:** 16px size, matching the item text color
- **Section header:** Uppercase, tracked, muted text
